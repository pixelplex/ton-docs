# 🚥 Working With Wallet Smart Contracts

## 📬  External and Internal Messages

In this section, we’ll learn more about `internal` and `external` messages and we’ll create messages and send them to the network to minimize the use of pre-cooked functions.

To carry out this process it is necessary to make use of a ready-made wallet to make the task easier. To accomplish this:
1. Install the [wallet app](/participate/wallets/apps) (e.g., Tonkeeper is used by the author)  
2. Switch wallet app to v3r2 address version
3. Deposit 1 TON into the wallet 
4. Send the message to another address (you can send to yourself, to the same wallet). 

This way, the Tonkeeper wallet app will deploy the wallet contract and we can use it for the following steps.

:::note
At the time of writing, most wallet apps on TON by default use the wallet v4 version. Plugins are not required in this tutorial and we’ll make use of the functionality provided by wallet v3. During use, Tonkeeper allows the user to choose the version of the wallet they want. Therefore, it is recommended to deploy wallet version 3 (wallet v3).
:::

### TL-B

As noted, everything in TON Blockchain is a smart contract consisting of cells. To properly serialize and deserialize the data we need standards. To accomplish the serialization and deserialization process, `TL-B` was created as a universal tool to describe different data types in different ways with different sequences inside cells.

In this section, we’ll examine [block.tlb](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/block/block.tlb). This file will be very useful during future development, as it describes how different cells should be assembled. In our case specifically, it details the intricacies of internal and external messages.

:::info
Basic information will be provided within this guide. For further details, please refer to our TL-B [documentation](/develop/data-formats/tl-b-language) to learn more about TL-B.
:::

### CommonMsgInfo

Initially, each message must first store `CommonMsgInfo` ([TL-B](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L123-L130)) or `CommonMsgInfoRelaxed` ([TL-B](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L132-L137)). This allows us to define technical details that relate to the message type, message time, recipient address, technical flags, and fees.

By reading `block.tlb` file, we can notice three types of CommonMsgInfo: `int_msg_info$0`, `ext_in_msg_info$10`, `ext_out_msg_info$11`. We will not go into specific details detailing the specificities of the `ext_out_msg_info` TL-B structure. That said, it is an external message type that a smart contract can send for using as external logs. For examples of this format, consider having a closer look at the [Elector]((https://tonscan.org/address/Ef8zMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzM0vF)) contract.


[Looking at TL-B](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L127-L128), you’ll notice that **only the CommonMsgInfo is available when used with the ext_in_msg_info type**. This is because message fields such as `src`, `created_lt`, `created_at`, and others are rewritten by validators during transaction handling. In this case, the `src` field in message is most important because when messages are sent, the sender is unknown, and is written by validators during verification. This ensures that the address in the `src` field is correct and cannot be manipulated.

However, the `CommonMsgInfo` structure only supports the `MsgAddress` specification, but the sender’s address is typically unknown and it is required to write the `addr_none` (two zero bits `00`). In this case, the `CommonMsgInfoRelaxed` structure is used, which supports the `addr_none` address. For the `ext_in_msg_info` (used for incoming external messages), the `CommonMsgInfo` structure is used because these message types don’t make use of a sender and always use the [MsgAddressExt](https://hub.com/ton/ton.blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L100) structure (the `addr_none$00` meaning two zero bits), which means there is no need to overwrite the data.

:::note
The numbers after `$` symbol are the bits that are required to store at the beginning of a certain structure, for further identification of these structures during reading (deserialization).
:::

### Internal Message Creation

Internal messages are used to send messages between contracts. When analyzing various contract types (such as [NFTs](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/f2253cb0f0e1ae0974d7dc0cef3a62cb6e19f806/nft/nft-item.fc#L51-L56) and [Jetons](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/f2253cb0f0e1ae0974d7dc0cef3a62cb6e19f806/ft/jetton-wallet.fc#L139-L144)) that send messages where the writing of contracts is considered, the following lines of code are often used:

```func
var msg = begin_cell()
  .store_uint(0x18, 6) ;; or 0x10 for non-bounce
  .store_slice(to_address)
  .store_coins(amount)
  .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1) ;; default message headers (see sending messages page)
  ;; store something as a body
```

Let’s first consider `0x18` and `0x10` (x - hexadecimal), which are hexadecimal numbers laid out in the following manner (given that we allocate 6 bits): `011000` and `010000`. This means that the code above can be overwritten as follows:

```func
var msg = begin_cell()
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; this bit indicates that we send an internal message according to int_msg_info$0  
  .store_uint(1, 1) ;; IHR Disabled
  .store_uint(1, 1) ;; or .store_uint(0, 1) for 0x10 | bounce
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; bounced
  .store_uint(0, 2) ;; src -> two zero bits for addr_none
  .store_slice(to_address)
  .store_coins(amount)
  .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1) ;; default message headers (see sending messages page)
  ;; store something as a body
```
Now let’s go through each option in detail:

Option | Explanation
:---: | :---:
IHR Disabled | Currently, this option is disabled (which means we store 1) because Instant Hypercube Routing is not fully implemented. In addition, this will be needed when a large number of [Shardchains](/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain#many-accountchains-shards) are live on the network. More can be read about the IHR Disabled option in the [tblkch.pdf](https://ton.org/tblkch.pdf) (chapter 2).
Bounce | While sending messages, a variety of errors can occur during smart contract processing. To avoid losing TON, it is necessary to set the Bounce option to 1 (true). In this case, if any contract errors occur during transaction processing, the message will be returned to the sender, and the same amount of TON will be received minus fees. More can be read about non-bounceable messages [here](/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/non-bouncable-messages).
Bounced | Bounced messages are messages that are returned to the sender because an error occurred while processing the transaction with a smart contract. This option tells you whether the message received is bounced or not.
Src | The Src is the sender address. In this case, two zero bits are written to indicate the `addr_none` address.

The next two lines of code:
```func
...
.store_slice(to_address)
.store_coins(amount)
...
```
- we specify the recipient and the number of TON to be sent.

Finally, let’s look at the remaining lines of code:

```func
...
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; Extra currency
  .store_uint(0, 4) ;; IHR fee
  .store_uint(0, 4) ;; Forwarding fee
  .store_uint(0, 64) ;; Logical time of creation
  .store_uint(0, 32) ;; UNIX time of creation
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; State Init
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; Message body
  ;; store something as a body
```
Option | Explanation
:---: | :---:
Extra currency | This is a native implementation of existing jettons and is not currently in use.
IHR fee | As mentioned, the IHR is not currently in use, so this fee is always zero. More can be read about this in the [tblkch.pdf](https://ton.org/tblkch.pdf) (3.1.8).
Forwarding fee | A forwarding message fee. More can be read about this in the [fees documentation](/develop/howto/fees-low-level#transactions-and-phases).
Logical time of creation | The time used to create the correct messages queue. 
UNIX time of creation | The time the message was created in UNIX.
State Init | Code and source data for deploying a smart contract. If the bit is set to `0`, it means that we do not have a State Init. But if it is set to `1`, then another bit needs to be written which indicates whether the State Init is stored in the same cell (0) or written as a reference (1).
Message body | This part defines how the message body is stored. At times the message body is too large to fit into the message itself. In this case, it should be stored as a **reference** whereby the bit is set to `1` to show that the body is used as a reference. If the bit is `0`, the body is in the same cell as the message.

The values outlined above (including src) excluding the State Init and the Message Body bits, are rewritten by validators.

:::note
If the number value fits within fewer bits than is specified, then the missing zeros are added to the left side of the value. For example, 0x18 fits within 5 bits -> `11000`. However, since 6 bits were specified, the end result becomes `011000`.
:::


Next, we’ll begin preparing a message, which will be sent Toncoins to another wallet v3.
First, let’s say a user wants to send 0.5 TON to themselves with the text "**Hello, TON!**", refer to this section of our documentation to learn ([How to send message with a comment](/develop/func/cookbook#how-to-send-a-simple-message)).

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { beginCell } from '@ton/core';

let internalMessageBody = beginCell()
  .storeUint(0, 32) // write 32 zero bits to indicate that a text comment will follow
  .storeStringTail("Hello, TON!") // write our text comment
  .endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
	"github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tvm/cell"
)

internalMessageBody := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0, 32). // write 32 zero bits to indicate that a text comment will follow
  MustStoreStringSnake("Hello, TON!"). // write our text comment
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Above we created an `InternalMessageBody` in which the body of our message is stored. Note that when storing text that does not fit into a single Cell (1023 bits), it is necessary **to split the data into several cells** according to [the following documentation](/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/internal-messages). However, in this case the high-level libraries creates cells according to requirements, so at this stage there is no need to worry about it.

Next, the `InternalMessage` is created according to the information we have studied earlier as follows:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { toNano, Address } from '@ton/ton';

const walletAddress = Address.parse('put your wallet address');

let internalMessage = beginCell()
  .storeUint(0, 1) // indicate that it is an internal message -> int_msg_info$0
  .storeBit(1) // IHR Disabled
  .storeBit(1) // bounce
  .storeBit(0) // bounced
  .storeUint(0, 2) // src -> addr_none
  .storeAddress(walletAddress)
  .storeCoins(toNano("0.2")) // amount
  .storeBit(0) // Extra currency
  .storeCoins(0) // IHR Fee
  .storeCoins(0) // Forwarding Fee
  .storeUint(0, 64) // Logical time of creation
  .storeUint(0, 32) // UNIX time of creation
  .storeBit(0) // No State Init
  .storeBit(1) // We store Message Body as a reference
  .storeRef(internalMessageBody) // Store Message Body as a reference
  .endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/address"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tlb"
)

walletAddress := address.MustParseAddr("put your address")

internalMessage := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0, 1). // indicate that it is an internal message -> int_msg_info$0
  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // IHR Disabled
  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // bounce
  MustStoreBoolBit(false). // bounced
  MustStoreUInt(0, 2). // src -> addr_none
  MustStoreAddr(walletAddress).
  MustStoreCoins(tlb.MustFromTON("0.2").NanoTON().Uint64()).   // amount
  MustStoreBoolBit(false). // Extra currency
  MustStoreCoins(0). // IHR Fee
  MustStoreCoins(0). // Forwarding Fee
  MustStoreUInt(0, 64). // Logical time of creation
  MustStoreUInt(0, 32). // UNIX time of creation
  MustStoreBoolBit(false). // No State Init
  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // We store Message Body as a reference
  MustStoreRef(internalMessageBody). // Store Message Body as a reference
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Creating a Message

It is necessary to retrieve the `seqno` (sequence number) of our wallet smart contract. To accomplish this, a `Client` is created which will be used to send a request to run the Get method "seqno" of our wallet. It is also necessary to add a seed phrase (which you saved during creating a wallet [here](#--external-and-internal-messages)) to sign our message via the following steps:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { TonClient } from '@ton/ton';
import { mnemonicToWalletKey } from '@ton/crypto';

const client = new TonClient({
  endpoint: "https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC",
  apiKey: "put your api key" // you can get an api key from @tonapibot bot in Telegram
});

const mnemonic = 'put your mnemonic'; // word1 word2 word3
let getMethodResult = await client.runMethod(walletAddress, "seqno"); // run "seqno" GET method from your wallet contract
let seqno = getMethodResult.stack.readNumber(); // get seqno from response

const mnemonicArray = mnemonic.split(' '); // get array from string
const keyPair = await mnemonicToWalletKey(mnemonicArray); // get Secret and Public keys from mnemonic 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "context"
  "crypto/ed25519"
  "crypto/hmac"
  "crypto/sha512"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/liteclient"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/ton"
  "golang.org/x/crypto/pbkdf2"
  "log"
  "strings"
)

mnemonic := strings.Split("put your mnemonic", " ") // get our mnemonic as array

connection := liteclient.NewConnectionPool()
configUrl := "https://ton-blockchain.github.io/global.config.json"
err := connection.AddConnectionsFromConfigUrl(context.Background(), configUrl)
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
client := ton.NewAPIClient(connection) // create client

block, err := client.CurrentMasterchainInfo(context.Background()) // get current block, we will need it in requests to LiteServer
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalln("CurrentMasterchainInfo err:", err.Error())
  return
}

getMethodResult, err := client.RunGetMethod(context.Background(), block, walletAddress, "seqno") // run "seqno" GET method from your wallet contract
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalln("RunGetMethod err:", err.Error())
  return
}
seqno := getMethodResult.MustInt(0) // get seqno from response

// The next three lines will extract the private key using the mnemonic phrase. We will not go into cryptographic details. With the tonutils-go library, this is all implemented, but we’re doing it again to get a full understanding.
mac := hmac.New(sha512.New, []byte(strings.Join(mnemonic, " ")))
hash := mac.Sum(nil)
k := pbkdf2.Key(hash, []byte("TON default seed"), 100000, 32, sha512.New) // In TON libraries "TON default seed" is used as salt when getting keys

privateKey := ed25519.NewKeyFromSeed(k)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Therefore, the `seqno`, `keys`, and `internal message` need to be sent. Now we need to create a [message](/develop/smart-contracts/messages) for our wallet and store the data in this message in the sequence used at the beginning of the tutorial. This is accomplished as follows:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { sign } from '@ton/crypto';

let toSign = beginCell()
  .storeUint(698983191, 32) // subwallet_id | We consider this further
  .storeUint(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1e3) + 60, 32) // Message expiration time, +60 = 1 minute
  .storeUint(seqno, 32) // store seqno
  .storeUint(3, 8) // store mode of our internal message
  .storeRef(internalMessage); // store our internalMessage as a reference

let signature = sign(toSign.endCell().hash(), keyPair.secretKey); // get the hash of our message to wallet smart contract and sign it to get signature

let body = beginCell()
  .storeBuffer(signature) // store signature
  .storeBuilder(toSign) // store our message
  .endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "time"
)

toSign := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(698983191, 32). // subwallet_id | We consider this further
  MustStoreUInt(uint64(time.Now().UTC().Unix()+60), 32). // Message expiration time, +60 = 1 minute
  MustStoreUInt(seqno.Uint64(), 32). // store seqno
  MustStoreUInt(uint64(3), 8). // store mode of our internal message
  MustStoreRef(internalMessage) // store our internalMessage as a reference

signature := ed25519.Sign(privateKey, toSign.EndCell().Hash()) // get the hash of our message to wallet smart contract and sign it to get signature

body := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreSlice(signature, 512). // store signature
  MustStoreBuilder(toSign). // store our message
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that here no `.endCell()` was used in the definition of the `toSign`. The fact is that in this case it is necessary **to transfer toSign content directly to the message body**. If writing a cell was required, it would have to be stored as a reference.


:::tip Wallet V4
In addition to basic verification process we learned bellow for the Wallet V3, Wallet V4 smart contracts [extracts the opcode to determine whether a simple translation or a message associated with the plugin](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/4111fd9e3313ec17d99ca9b5b1656445b5b49d8f/func/wallet-v4-code.fc#L94-L100) is required. To match this version, it is necessary to add the `storeUint(0, 8).` (JS/TS), `MustStoreUInt(0, 8).` (Golang) functions after writing the seqno (sequence number) and before specifying the transaction mode.
:::

### External Message Creation

To deliver any internal message to a blockchain from the outside world, it is necessary to send it within an external message. As we have previously considered, it is necessary to only make use of the `ext_in_msg_info$10` structure, as the goal is to send an external message to our contract. Now, let's create an external message that will be sent to our wallet:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
let externalMessage = beginCell()
  .storeUint(0b10, 2) // 0b10 -> 10 in binary
  .storeUint(0, 2) // src -> addr_none
  .storeAddress(walletAddress) // Destination address
  .storeCoins(0) // Import Fee
  .storeBit(0) // No State Init
  .storeBit(1) // We store Message Body as a reference
  .storeRef(body) // Store Message Body as a reference
  .endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
externalMessage := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0b10, 2). // 0b10 -> 10 in binary
  MustStoreUInt(0, 2). // src -> addr_none
  MustStoreAddr(walletAddress). // Destination address
  MustStoreCoins(0). // Import Fee
  MustStoreBoolBit(false). // No State Init
  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // We store Message Body as a reference
  MustStoreRef(body). // Store Message Body as a reference
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Option | Explanation
:---: | :---:
Src | The sender address. Since an incoming external message cannot have a sender, there will always be 2 zero bits (an addr_none [TL-B](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L100)).
Import Fee | The fee used to pay for importing incoming external messages.
State Init | Unlike the Internal Message, the State Init within the external message is needed **to deploy a contract from the outside world**. The State Init used in conjunction with the Internal Message allows one contract to deploy another.
Message Body | The message that must be sent to the contract for processing.

:::tip 0b10
0b10 (b - binary) denotes a binary record. In this process, two bits are stored: `1` and `0`. Thus we specify that it's `ext_in_msg_info$10`.
:::

Now we have a completed message that is ready to be sent to our contract. To accomplish this, it should first be serialized to a `BOC` ([Bag of Cells](/develop/data-formats/cell-boc#bag-of-cells)), then be sent using the following code:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
console.log(externalMessage.toBoc().toString("base64"))

client.sendFile(externalMessage.toBoc());
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "encoding/base64"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tl"
)

log.Println(base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(externalMessage.ToBOCWithFlags(false)))

var resp tl.Serializable
err = client.Client().QueryLiteserver(context.Background(), ton.SendMessage{Body: externalMessage.ToBOCWithFlags(false)}, &resp)

if err != nil {
  log.Fatalln(err.Error())
  return
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> 💡 Useful link:
>
> [More about Bag of Cells](/develop/data-formats/cell-boc#bag-of-cells)

As a result, we got the output of our BOC in the console and the message sent to our wallet. By copying the base64 encoded string, it is possible to [manually send our message and retrieve the hash using toncenter](https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/send/send_boc_return_hash_sendBocReturnHash_post).



## 💸 Working With Wallet Smart Contracts

After completing the first half of this tutorial we’re now much more familiar with wallet smart contracts and how they are developed and used. We learned how to deploy and destroy them and send messages without depending on pre-configured library functions. To apply more of what we learned above, in the next section, we’ll focus on building and sending more complex messages.

### Sending Multiple Messages Simultaneously

As you may already know, [one cell can store up to 1023 bits of data and up to 4 references](/develop/data-formats/cell-boc#cell) to other cells. In the first section of this tutorial we detailed how internal messages are delivered in a ‘whole’ loop as a link and sent. This means it is possible to **store up to 4 internal messages inside the external** message. This allows four messages to be sent at the same time.

To accomplish this, it is necessary to create 4 different internal messages. We can do this manually or through a `loop`. We need to define 3 arrays: array of TON amount, array of comments, array of messages. For messages, we need to prepare another one array - internalMessages.

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Cell } from '@ton/core';

const internalMessagesAmount = ["0.01", "0.02", "0.03", "0.04"];
const internalMessagesComment = [
  "Hello, TON! #1",
  "Hello, TON! #2",
  "", // Let's leave the third message without comment
  "Hello, TON! #4" 
]
const destinationAddresses = [
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you"
] // All 4 addresses can be the same

let internalMessages:Cell[] = []; // array for our internal messages
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tvm/cell"
)

internalMessagesAmount := [4]string{"0.01", "0.02", "0.03", "0.04"}
internalMessagesComment := [4]string{
  "Hello, TON! #1",
  "Hello, TON! #2",
  "", // Let's leave the third message without comment
  "Hello, TON! #4",
}
destinationAddresses := [4]string{
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
} // All 4 addresses can be the same

var internalMessages [len(internalMessagesAmount)]*cell.Cell // array for our internal messages
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

[Sending mode](/develop/smart-contracts/messages#message-modes) for all messages is set to `mode 3`.  However, if different modes are required an array can be created to fulfill different purposes.

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Address, beginCell, toNano } from '@ton/core';

for (let index = 0; index < internalMessagesAmount.length; index++) {
  const amount = internalMessagesAmount[index];
  
  let internalMessage = beginCell()
      .storeUint(0x18, 6) // bounce
      .storeAddress(Address.parse(destinationAddresses[index]))
      .storeCoins(toNano(amount))
      .storeUint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1);
      
  /*
      At this stage, it is not clear if we will have a message body. 
      So put a bit only for stateInit, and if we have a comment, in means 
      we have a body message. In that case, set the bit to 1 and store the 
      body as a reference.
  */

  if(internalMessagesComment[index] != "") {
    internalMessage.storeBit(1) // we store Message Body as a reference

    let internalMessageBody = beginCell()
      .storeUint(0, 32)
      .storeStringTail(internalMessagesComment[index])
      .endCell();

    internalMessage.storeRef(internalMessageBody);
  } 
  else 
    /*
        Since we do not have a message body, we indicate that 
        the message body is in this message, but do not write it, 
        which means it is absent. In that case, just set the bit to 0.
    */
    internalMessage.storeBit(0);
  
  internalMessages.push(internalMessage.endCell());
}
```

Now let's use our knowledge from [chapter two](/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet#-deploying-our-wallet) to build a message for our wallet that can send 4 messages simultaneously:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { TonClient } from '@ton/ton';

  apiKey: "put your api key" // you can get an api key from @tonapibot bot in Telegram
});

const mnemonic = 'put your mnemonic'; // word1 word2 word3
let getMethodResult = await client.runMethod(walletAddress, "seqno"); // run "seqno" GET method from your wallet contract
let seqno = getMethodResult.stack.readNumber(); // get seqno from response

const mnemonicArray = mnemonic.split(' '); // get array from string

let toSign = beginCell()
  .storeUint(698983191, 32) // subwallet_id

  MustStoreUInt(seqno.Uint64(), 32) // store seqno
  // Do not forget that if we use Wallet V4, we need to add MustStoreUInt(0, 8). 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, we’ll add our messages that we built earlier in the loop:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
for (let index = 0; index < internalMessages.length; index++) {
  const internalMessage = internalMessages[index];
  toSign.storeUint(3, 8) // store mode of our internal message

		toSign.MustStoreRef(internalMessage) // store our internalMessage as a reference
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that the above processes are complete, let’s **sign** our message, **build an external message** (as outlined in previous sections of this tutorial) and **send it** to the blockchain:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { sign } from '@ton/crypto';

let signature = sign(toSign.endCell().hash(), keyPair.secretKey); // get the hash of our message to wallet smart contract and sign it to get signature

  EndCell()

var resp tl.Serializable
err = client.Client().QueryLiteserver(context.Background(), ton.SendMessage{Body: externalMessage.ToBOCWithFlags(false)}, &resp)

if err != nil {
  log.Fatalln(err.Error())
  return
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Connection error
If an error related to the lite-server connection (Golang) occurs, the code must be run until the message can be sent. This is because the tonutils-go library uses several different lite-servers through the global configuration that have been specified in the code. However, not all lite-servers can accept our connection.
:::

After this process is completed it is possible to use a TON blockchain explorer to verify that the wallet sent four messages to the addresses previously specified.

### NFT Transfers

In addition to regular messages, users often send NFTs to each other. Unfortunately, not all libraries contain methods that are tailored for use with this type of smart contract. Therefore, it is necessary to create code that will allow us to build a message for sending NFTs. First, let's become more familiar with the TON NFT [standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md).

Especially, we need to understand TL-B for [NFT Transfers](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md#1-transfer) in details. 

- `query_id`: Query ID has no value in terms of message processing. The NFT contract doesn't validate it; it only reads it. This value can be useful when a service wants to assign a specific query ID to each of its messages for identification purposes. Therefore, we will set it to 0.

- `response_destination`: After processing the ownership change message there will be extra TON. They will be sent to this address, if specified, otherwise remain on the NFT balance.

- `custom_payload`: The custom_payload is needed to carry out specific tasks and is not used with ordinary NFTs.

- `forward_amount`: If the forward_amount isn’t zero, the specified TON amount will be sent to the new owner. That way the new owner will be notified that they received something.

- `forward_payload`: The forward_payload is additional data that can be sent to the new owner together with the forward_amount. For example, using forward_payload allows users to [add a comment during the transfer of the NFT](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md#forward_payload-format), as shown in the tutorial earlier. However, although the forward_payload is written within TON’s NFT standard, blockchain explorers do not fully support displaying various details. The same problem also exists when displaying Jettons.

Now let's build the message itself:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Address, beginCell, toNano } from '@ton/core';

const destinationAddress = Address.parse("put your wallet where you want to send NFT");
const walletAddress = Address.parse("put your wallet which is the owner of NFT")
const nftAddress = Address.parse("put your nft address");

// We can add a comment, but it will not be displayed in the explorers, 
// as it is not supported by them at the time of writing the tutorial.
const forwardPayload = beginCell()
  .storeUint(0, 32)
  .storeStringTail("Hello, TON!")
  .endCell();

const transferNftBody = beginCell()
  .storeUint(0x5fcc3d14, 32) // Opcode for NFT transfer
  .storeUint(0, 64) // query_id
  .storeAddress(destinationAddress) // new_owner
  .storeAddress(walletAddress) // response_destination for excesses
  .storeBit(0) // we do not have custom_payload
  .storeCoins(toNano("0.01")) // forward_amount
  .storeBit(1) // we store forward_payload as a reference
  .storeRef(forwardPayload) // store forward_payload as a .reference
  .endCell();

const internalMessage = beginCell().
  storeUint(0x18, 6). // bounce
  storeAddress(nftAddress).
  storeCoins(toNano("0.05")).
  storeUint(1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1). // We store 1 that means we have body as a reference
  storeRef(transferNftBody).
  endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (

)

destinationAddress := address.MustParseAddr("put your wallet where you want to send NFT")
walletAddress := address.MustParseAddr("put your wallet which is the owner of NFT")
nftAddress := address.MustParseAddr("put your nft address")

// We can add a comment, but it will not be displayed in the explorers,
// as it is not supported by them at the time of writing the tutorial.
forwardPayload := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0, 32).
  MustStoreStringSnake("Hello, TON!").
  EndCell()

transferNftBody := cell.BeginCell().

  MustStoreRef(transferNftBody).
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The NFT transfer opcode comes from [the same standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md#tl-b-schema).
Now let's complete the message, as is laid out in the previous sections of this tutorial. The correct code needed to complete the message is found in the [GitHub repository](/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet#source-code).

The same procedure can be completed with Jettons. To conduct this process, read the TL-B [standart](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md) for jettons transfer. To this point specifically, a small difference between NFT and Jettons transfers exists.

### Wallet v3 and Wallet v4 Get Methods

Smart contracts often make use of [GET methods](/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/get-methods), however, they don’t run inside the blockchain but instead on the client side. GET methods have many uses and provide accessibility to different data types for smart contracts. For example, the [get_nft_data() method in NFT smart contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/991bdb4925653c51b0b53ab212c53143f71f5476/nft/nft-item.fc#L142-L145) allows users to retrieve specific content, owner, and NFT collection information.

Below we’ll learn more about the basics of GET methods used with [V3](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/e37583e5e6e8cd0aebf5142ef7d8db282f10692b/crypto/smartcont/wallet3-code.fc#L31-L41) and [V4](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/4111fd9e3313ec17d99ca9b5b1656445b5b49d8f/func/wallet-v4-code.fc#L164-L198). Let’s start with the methods that are the same for both wallet versions:

Method | Explanation
:---: | :---:
int seqno() | This method is needed to receive the current seqno and send messages with the correct value. In previous sections of this tutorial, this method was called often.
int get_public_key() | This method is used to retrive a public key. The get_public_key() is not broadly used, and can be used by different services. For example, some API services allow for the retrieval of numerous wallets with the same public key

Now let’s move to the methods that only the V4 wallet makes use of:

Method | Explanation
:---: | :---:
int get_subwallet_id() | Earlier in the tutorial we considered this. This method allows you to retrive subwallet_id.
int is_plugin_installed(int wc, int addr_hash) | Let’s us know if the plugin has been installed. To call this method it’s necessary to pass the  [workchain](/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain#workchain-blockchain-with-your-own-rules) and the plugin address hash.
tuple get_plugin_list() | This method returns the address of the plugins that are installed.

Let’s consider the `get_public_key` and the `is_plugin_installed` methods. These two methods were chosen because at first we would have to get a public key from 256 bits of data, and after that we would have to learn how to pass a slice and different types of data to GET methods. This is very useful to help us learn how to properly make use of these methods.

First we need a client that is capable of sending requests. Therefore, we’ll use a specific wallet address ([EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF](https://tonscan.org/address/EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF)) as an example:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { TonClient } from '@ton/ton';
import { Address } from '@ton/core';

const client = new TonClient({
    endpoint: "https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC",
    apiKey: "put your api key" // you can get an api key from @tonapibot bot in Telegram
});

const walletAddress = Address.parse("EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF"); // my wallet address as an example
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "context"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/address"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/liteclient"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/ton"
  "log"
)

connection := liteclient.NewConnectionPool()
configUrl := "https://ton-blockchain.github.io/global.config.json"
err := connection.AddConnectionsFromConfigUrl(context.Background(), configUrl)
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
client := ton.NewAPIClient(connection)

block, err := client.CurrentMasterchainInfo(context.Background()) // get current block, we will need it in requests to LiteServer
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalln("CurrentMasterchainInfo err:", err.Error())
  return
}

walletAddress := address.MustParseAddr("EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF") // my wallet address as an example
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we need to call the GET method wallet.

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
// I always call runMethodWithError instead of runMethod to be able to check the exit_code of the called method. 
let getResult = await client.runMethodWithError(walletAddress, "get_public_key"); // run get_public_key GET Method
const publicKeyUInt = getResult.stack.readBigNumber(); // read answer that contains uint256
const publicKey = publicKeyUInt.toString(16); // get hex string from bigint (uint256)
console.log(publicKey)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
getResult, err := client.RunGetMethod(context.Background(), block, walletAddress, "get_public_key") // run get_public_key GET Method
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("RunGetMethod err:", err.Error())
	return
}

// We have a response as an array with values and should specify the index when reading it
// In the case of get_public_key, we have only one returned value that is stored at 0 index
publicKeyUInt := getResult.MustInt(0) // read answer that contains uint256
publicKey := publicKeyUInt.Text(16)   // get hex string from bigint (uint256)
log.Println(publicKey)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the call is successfully completed the end result is an extremely large 256 bit number which must be translated into a hex string. The resulting hex string for the wallet address we provided above is as follows: `430db39b13cf3cb76bfa818b6b13417b82be2c6c389170fbe06795c71996b1f8`.
Next, we leverage the [TonAPI](https://tonapi.io/swagger-ui) (/v1/wallet/findByPubkey method), by inputting the obtained hex string into the system and it is immediately clear that the first element in the array within the answer will identify my wallet.

Then we switch to the `is_plugin_installed` method. As an example, we’ll again use the wallet we used earlier ([EQAM7M--HGyfxlErAIUODrxBA3yj5roBeYiTuy6BHgJ3Sx8k](https://tonscan.org/address/EQAM7M--HGyfxlErAIUODrxBA3yj5roBeYiTuy6BHgJ3Sx8k)) and the plugin ([EQBTKTis-SWYdupy99ozeOvnEBu8LRrQP_N9qwOTSAy3sQSZ](https://tonscan.org/address/EQBTKTis-SWYdupy99ozeOvnEBu8LRrQP_N9qwOTSAy3sQSZ)):

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const oldWalletAddress = Address.parse("EQAM7M--HGyfxlErAIUODrxBA3yj5roBeYiTuy6BHgJ3Sx8k"); // my old wallet address
const subscriptionAddress = Address.parseFriendly("EQBTKTis-SWYdupy99ozeOvnEBu8LRrQP_N9qwOTSAy3sQSZ"); // subscription plugin address which is already installed on the wallet
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
oldWalletAddress := address.MustParseAddr("EQAM7M--HGyfxlErAIUODrxBA3yj5roBeYiTuy6BHgJ3Sx8k")
subscriptionAddress := address.MustParseAddr("EQBTKTis-SWYdupy99ozeOvnEBu8LRrQP_N9qwOTSAy3sQSZ") // subscription plugin address which is already installed on the wallet
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we need to retrieve the plugin’s hash address so the address can be translated into a number and sent to the GET Method.

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const hash = BigInt(`0x${subscriptionAddress.address.hash.toString("hex")}`) ;

getResult = await client.runMethodWithError(oldWalletAddress, "is_plugin_installed", 
[
    {type: "int", value: BigInt("0")}, // pass workchain as int
    {type: "int", value: hash} // pass plugin address hash as int
]);
console.log(getResult.stack.readNumber()); // -1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "math/big"
)

hash := big.NewInt(0).SetBytes(subscriptionAddress.Data())
// runGetMethod will automatically identify types of passed values
getResult, err = client.RunGetMethod(context.Background(), block, oldWalletAddress,
  "is_plugin_installed",
  0,    // pass workchain
  hash) // pass plugin address
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalln("RunGetMethod err:", err.Error())
  return
}

log.Println(getResult.MustInt(0)) // -1
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The response must be `-1`, meaning the result is true. It is also possible to send a slice and a cell if required. It would be enough to create a Slice or Cell and transfer it instead of using the BigInt, specifying the appropriate type.

### Contract Deployment via Wallet

In chapter three, we deployed a wallet. To accomplish this, we initially sent some TON and then a message from the wallet to deploy a smart contract. However, this process is not broadly used with external messages and is often primarily used for wallets only. While developing contracts, the deployment process is initialized by sending internal messages.

To accomplish this, will use the V3R2 wallet smart contract that was used in [the third chapter](/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet#compiling-our-wallet-code).
In this case, we’ll set the `subwallet_id` to `3` or any other number needed to retrieve another address when using the same private key (it's changeable):

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

const dataCell = beginCell()

Next we’ll retrieve the address from our contract and build the InternalMessage. Also we add the "Deploying..." comment to our message.

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Address, toNano } from '@ton/core';

const contractAddress = new Address(0, stateInit.hash()); // get the hash of stateInit to get the address of our smart contract in workchain with ID 0
console.log(`Contract address: ${contractAddress.toString()}`); // Output contract address to console

const internalMessageBody = beginCell()
    .storeUint(0, 32)
    .storeStringTail('Deploying...')
    .endCell();

const internalMessage = beginCell()
    .storeUint(0x10, 6) // no bounce
    .storeAddress(contractAddress)
    .storeCoins(toNano('0.01'))
    .storeUint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32)
    .storeBit(1) // We have State Init
    .storeBit(1) // We store State Init as a reference

:::info
Note that above, the bits have been specified and that the stateInit and internalMessageBody have been saved as references. Since the links are stored separately, we could write 4 (0b100) + 2 (0b10) + 1 (0b1) -> (4 + 2 + 1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 + 1) which means (0b111, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 + 1) and then save two references.

This concludes our work with ordinary wallets. At this stage, you should have a strong understanding of how to interact with wallet smart contracts, send messages, and be able to use various library types.
